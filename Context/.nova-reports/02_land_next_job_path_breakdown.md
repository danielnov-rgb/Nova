# Land Your Next Job: Path Breakdown

> **Document Purpose**: Comprehensive breakdown of the "Land Your Next Job: The Evidence-Based Approach" learning path
> **Last Updated**: February 2026
> **Version**: POC (Proof of Concept)

---

## 1. Path Overview

### Who This Path Is For

Professionals at any career stage who struggle to:
- Get callbacks despite being qualified
- Document and articulate their achievements
- Stand out in a competitive job market (150-300 applications per advertised role in SA)
- Bridge the gap between having skills and proving them to strangers

### The Problem It Solves

**The Evidence Deficit**: Most job seekers fail not because they lack skills, but because they lack evidence. The path addresses the gap between what professionals *can do* and what they can *prove* they can do to a stranger in under seven seconds.

### The End Outcome

Upon completion, users will have:
- A **SOAR-transformed CV** with quantified impact statements
- **Two portfolio artifacts**: one from existing experience, one quick-proof project
- An **optimized LinkedIn profile** working as a passive evidence platform
- A **4-paragraph evidence-based cover letter** template
- **Interview stories** structured for verbal delivery
- **Deployed applications** to 3 real roles with full evidence packages
- A clear **iteration framework** for learning from outcomes

## 5. Relationships and Sequencing

### Dependencies

The path uses **open mode** dependencies - users can complete go-cards in any order within a milestone. However, there are logical progressions:

```
M1 (Foundation) → M2 (CV Transform) → M3 (Portfolio) → M4 (Digital) → M5 (Validate) → M6 (Deploy)
```

### Cross-Milestone Dependencies

| Go-Card | Depends On | Reason |
|---------|------------|--------|
| GC-2-3 (Resume v1) | GC-2-1 (SOAR Article) | Needs SOAR framework understanding |
| GC-3-4 (Quick-Proof) | GC-3-3 (Generator) | Generator provides project ideas |
| GC-4-4 (Cover Letter) | GC-4-3 (Framework Article) | Needs 4-paragraph framework |
| GC-5-2 (Resume v2) | GC-2-3 (Resume v1) | v2 refines v1 |
| GC-5-4 (Story Builder) | GC-5-2 or GC-2-3 | Uses CV bullets as input |
| GC-6-2 (Deploy) | All M1-M5 evidence | Deploys complete package |
| GC-6-4 (Final Quiz) | GC-1-4 (Evidence Audit) | Measures growth from baseline |

### Essential vs Optional

| Category | Go-Cards | Impact |
|----------|----------|--------|
| **Essential** | 26 cards | Required for path completion |
| **Non-Essential** | 3 cards | Live Event (M5), some tools | Can be skipped without blocking |

### Locking Mechanisms

- **Insights cards** are locked until prerequisite content is completed
- **Evidence cards** require specific artifacts to unlock completion
- **Quiz pass thresholds**: Evidence Audit (70%), Final Evaluation (80%)

- M3: "Which quick-proof project type fits your target role?"
- M4: "What's the biggest change your LinkedIn needs?"
- M5: "Which blind spot affects you most?"
- M6: "Which SA channel will be most effective for you?"

### Insights Cards (AI-Generated Reports)

Each milestone concludes with an Insights card that synthesizes:
- **Progress Snapshot**: Strides earned, cards completed, time invested
- **Key Learnings**: Highlights from reflections, quiz results, assessments
- **Journey Narrative**: Before/after sentiment comparison
- **Focus Areas**: Distribution of effort across content types

### Peer Validation

- **Resume v2 (GC-5-2)** requires peer review exchange

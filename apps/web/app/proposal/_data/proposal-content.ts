  text: "This proposal outlines a 6-month engagement of a Forward Deployed Product Intelligence Team to accelerate path differentiation for the 2gthr platform. The team will design and build high-quality paths, milestones, and go-card solutions that drive daily active usage — each one validated with real users, backed by evidence, and ready for production. Three complete solutions delivered every month, moving at a pace that keeps 2gthr ahead of the curve while ensuring every solution has real substance for members.",
